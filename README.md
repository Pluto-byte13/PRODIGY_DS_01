AVERAGE MATH SCORE BY GENDER – VISUALIZATION PROJECT

This repository contains a simple data visualization project that demonstrates how to use Python (with Seaborn and Matplotlib) to plot the average math scores of students based on gender.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the difference in average math scores between male and female students. The visualization helps in understanding gender-based performance trends using bar plots.

OUTPUT

Below is the final output of the analysis: X-axis: Gender (male, female) Y-axis: Average Math Score Error bars: Represent standard error of the mean

TOOLS USED

Python 3.x Pandas Seaborn Matplotlib Jupyter Notebook
